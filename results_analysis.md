## **Results of Internalizing Psychopathology Model**

### **Model 1 – Total Severity and Internalizing Psychopathology**

This model tested whether the mean severity of negative life experiences (NLEs) predicted internalizing psychopathology in adolescents and whether this association was mediated by parent–child interaction (PCI) variables: warmth, rejection, structure, and interactiveness. The covarietes include child sex, child age, and income-to-needs ratio (ITN)

**Overall Effects**

There was a significant overall effect of **negative life experience severity** on **internalizing psychopathology**, controlling for child sex, age, and family income (ITN): *b* = 5.45, *t*(211) = 2.28, *p* = .024.

Greater severity of negative life events was associated with **higher internalizing symptoms** in adolescence.

Negative life experiences did **not significantly predict** any of the parent–child interaction (PCI) dimensions:

-   **PCI warmth**: *a₁* = –0.06, *t*(211) = –0.47, *p* = .642

-   **PCI rejection**: *a₂* = 0.20, *t*(211) = 1.78, *p* = .077

-   **PCI structure**: *a₃* = –0.15, *t*(211) = –1.36, *p* = .175

-   **PCI interactiveness**: *a₄* = 0.01, *t*(211) = 0.05, *p* = .961

**Direct Effects**

After accounting for all mediators and covariates, **PCI structure** showed a **marginal negative association** with internalizing symptoms: *b₃* = –3.62, *t*(207) = –1.92, *p* = .057\

This suggests that **higher parental structure** may be related to **lower internalizing symptoms**.

Other PCI dimensions were not significant predictors:

-   **PCI warmth**: *b₁* = –0.06, *t*(207) = –0.04, *p* = .972

-   **PCI rejection**: *b₂* = –0.19, *t*(207) = –0.10, *p* = .922

-   **PCI interactiveness**: *b₄* = –2.18, *t*(207) = –1.50, *p* = .135

The **direct effect** of negative life experience severity on internalizing psychopathology **remained significant** after accounting for mediators: *c′* = 4.97, *t*(207) = 2.09, *p* = .038

**Indirect Effects with Confidence Intervals**

The **total indirect effect** of negative life experience severity through PCI dimensions was **not significant**: 0.48, 95% CI \[–0.88, 2.00\]

None of the specific indirect effects were significant, as all bootstrapped confidence intervals included zero:

-   **PCI warmth**: 0.004, 95% CI \[–0.47, 0.51\]

-   **PCI rejection**: –0.04, 95% CI \[–1.17, 0.90\]

-   **PCI structure**: 0.53, 95% CI \[–0.29, 1.84\]

-   **PCI interactiveness**: –0.01, 95% CI \[–0.82, 0.74\]

These results indicate **no evidence of mediation** by PCI dimensions in the relationship between early negative life experiences and adolescent internalizing psychopathology in this sample. However, **parental structure may serve a modest protective role** against internalizing symptoms.

### Model 2 – Total Number of Events and Internalizing Psychopathology

This model tested whether the total number of negative life experiences (NLEs) predicted internalizing psychopathology in adolescents and whether this association was mediated by parent–child interaction (PCI) variables: warmth, rejection, structure, and interactiveness. Covariates included child sex, child age, and income-to-needs ratio (ITN).

#### Overall Effects

There was no significant overall effect of the number of negative life events on internalizing psychopathology, controlling for covariates (*b* = 0.25, *t*(211) = 1.60, *p* = .111). In other words, the total count of adverse events alone was **not a reliable predictor** of internalizing symptoms.

Negative life events did not significantly predict most PCI variables:

-   **PCI warmth:** *a*₁ = –0.009, *t*(211) = –1.13, *p* = .260

-   **PCI structure:** *a*₃ = –0.009, *t*(211) = –1.26, *p* = .209

-   **PCI interactiveness:** *a*₄ = 0.001, *t*(211) = 0.08, *p* = .934

However, greater number of negative life events was significantly associated with higher levels of parental rejection (*a*₂ = 0.017, *t*(211) = 2.39, *p* = .018).

#### Direct Effects

After accounting for PCI variables and covariates, parental structure showed a significant negative association with internalizing psychopathology (*b₃* = –3.77, *t*(207) = –1.99, *p* = .048), suggesting that more structure may buffer against symptoms.

Other PCI variables were not significant predictors:

-   **PCI warmth:** *b*₁ = 0.07, *t*(207) = 0.04, *p* = .967

-   **PCI rejection:** *b*₂ = –0.17, *t*(207) = –0.09, *p* = .930

-   **PCI interactiveness:** *b*₄ = –2.21, *t*(207) = –1.51, *p* = .133

The direct effect of negative life events on internalizing psychopathology became non-significant after controlling for PCI variables (*c′* = 0.22, *t*(207) = 1.43, *p* = .156).

### Indirect Effects with Confidence Intervals

The total indirect effect of negative life events on internalizing psychopathology through PCI variables was small and non-significant (0.03, 95% CI \[–0.08, 0.13\]).

None of the specific indirect effects reached significance:

-   **PCI warmth:** 0.001, 95% CI \[–0.05, 0.05\]

-   **PCI rejection:** –0.003, 95% CI \[–0.10, 0.07\]

-   **PCI structure:** 0.03, 95% CI \[–0.03, 0.12\]

-   **PCI interactiveness:** -0.002, 95% CI \[–0.06, 0.06\]

These findings suggest no evidence of mediation through PCI in the relationship between the number of negative life events and adolescent internalizing psychopathology.

## Results of [Externalizing]{.underline} Psychopathology Model

### **Model 3 – Total Severity and External Psychopathology**

This model tested whether the mean severity of negative life experiences (NLEs) predicted externalizing psychopathology in adolescents and whether this association was mediated by parent–child interaction (PCI) variables: warmth, rejection, structure, and interactiveness. Covariates included child sex, child age, and income-to-needs ratio (ITN).

#### Overall Effects

The severity of negative life experiences was significantly associated with externalizing psychopathology after controlling for covariates (*b* = 5.79, *t*(211) = 2.81, *p* = .005).

Negative life experiences did not significantly predict:

-   **PCI Warmth:** *a*₁ = –0.06, *t*(211) = –0.47, *p* = .642

-   **PCI Rejection:** *a*₂ = 0.20, *t*(211) = 1.78, *p* = .077\*\* (marginal)

-   **PCI Structure:** *a*₃ = –0.15, *t*(211) = –1.36, *p* = .175

-   **PCI Interactiveness:** *a*₄ = 0.01, *t*(211) = 0.05, *p* = .961

#### Direct Effects

After accounting for all PCI variables and covariates, none of the PCI dimensions significantly predicted externalizing psychopathology:

-   **PCI warmth:** *b*₁ = –1.47, *t*(207) = –0.95, *p* = .344

-   **PCI rejection:** *b*₂ = 1.28, *t*(207) = 0.76, *p* = .446

-   **PCI structure:** *b*₃ = –0.80, *t*(207) = –0.49, *p* = .626

-   **PCI interactiveness:** *b*₄ = 0.11, *t*(207) = 0.08, *p* = .932

The direct effect of negative life experience severity on externalizing psychopathology remained significant after controlling for mediators (*c′* = 5.34, *t*(207) = 2.57, *p* = .011).I

#### Indirect Effects with Confidence Intervals

Bootstrapped analyses showed a small, non-significant total indirect effect of NLE severity on externalizing psychopathology through PCI variables (0.46, 95% CI \[–0.65, 1.65\]). None of the specific indirect effects were statistically significant, as all confidence intervals included zero:

-   **PCI warmth:** 0.08, 95% CI \[–0.41, 0.69\]

-   **PCI rejection:** 0.25, 95% CI \[–0.52, 1.23\]

-   **PCI structure:** 0.12, 95% CI \[–0.52, 0.91\]

-   **PCI interactiveness:** 0.001, 95% CI \[–0.31, 0.30\]

#### Contrast of Specific Indirect Effects

None of the contrasts between PCI indirect effects reached significance, indicating no meaningful difference in the strength of mediation among PCI dimensions.

### **Model 4 – Total Number of Events and External Psychopathology**

This model examined whether the total number of negative life events predicted externalizing psychopathology, with parent–child interaction (PCI) dimensions (warmth, rejection, structure, interactiveness) tested as mediators. Covariates included child sex, child age, and income-to-needs ratio (ITN).

#### Overall Effects

The total number of negative life events was positively associated with externalizing psychopathology after controlling for covariates (*b* = 0.36, *t*(207) = 2.68, *p* = .008).

The total number of negative life events significantly predicted increased parental **rejection** (*a*₂ = 0.02, *t*(211) = 2.39, *p* = .018), but were not significantly associated with:

-   **PCI warmth:** *a*₁ = –0.009, *t*(211) = –1.13, *p* = .260

-   **PCI structure:** *a*₃ = –0.009, *t*(211) = –1.26, *p* = .209

-   **PCI interactiveness:** *a*₄ = 0.001, *t*(211) = 0.08, *p* = .934

#### Direct Effects

After accounting for PCI variables and covariates, none of the PCI dimensions significantly predicted externalizing psychopathology:

-   **PCI warmth:** *b*₁ = –1.31, *t*(207) = –0.84, *p* = .401

-   **PCI rejection:** *b*₂ = 1.18, *t*(207) = 0.70, *p* = .485

-   **PCI structure:** *b*₃ = –0.96, *t*(207) = –0.58, *p* = .560

-   **PCI interactiveness:** *b*₄ = 0.05, *t*(207) = 0.04, *p* = .966

The direct effect of total negative life events on externalizing psychopathology remained significant (*c′* = 0.32, *t*(207) = 2.35, *p* = .020).

#### **Indirect Effects with Confidence Intervals**

Bootstrapped analyses revealed a small and non-significant total indirect effect of negative life events on externalizing psychopathology through PCI dimensions (0.04, 95% CI \[–0.03, 0.13\]). None of the specific indirect effects were significant as all confidence intervals included zero:

-   **PCI warmth:** effect = 0.012, 95% CI \[–0.02, 0.06\]

-   **PCI rejection:** effect = 0.020, 95% CI \[–0.04, 0.10\]

-   **PCI structure:** effect = 0.008, 95% CI \[–0.03, 0.06\]

-   **PCI interactiveness:** effect = 0.000, 95% CI \[–0.02, 0.02\]

None of the contrasts between indirect effects were significant, indicating no difference in mediation strength among PCI dimensions.

# Examining Contrast

**Which contrast should we conduct? What are the results of this test?**

We should conduct contrasts based on the difference of absolute values of indirect effects (PROCESS Model 4, contrast = 2), which accounts for differences in magnitude regardless of effect sign. Simply subtracting raw indirect effects could misrepresent their relative strength due to sign differences.

Contrasts of absolute indirect effects were conducted using PROCESS (contrast = 2) to determine whether the magnitude of mediation differed among the parent–child interaction (PCI) dimensions across all four models.

When looking at internalizing psychopathology as an outcome measure, Model 1 and Model 2 are used. In Model 1 (Total Severity and Internalizing Psychopathology), none of the contrasts were significant, with differences ranging from –0.53 to 0.05 (95% CI \[–1.74, 0.89\]). Similarly, Model 2 (Total Number of Events and Internalizing Psychopathology) contrasts ranged from –0.08 to 0.05 (95% CI \[–0.44, 0.42\]), showing no significant differences.

When looking at externalizing psychopathology as an outcome measure, Model 1 and Model 2 are used. For Model 3 (Total Severity and Externalizing Psychopathology), contrasts ranged from –0.42 to 0.25 (95% CI \[–1.03, 0.86\]), and Model 4 (Total Number of Events and Externalizing Psychopathology) contrasts ranged from –0.01 to 0.02 (95% CI \[–0.08, 0.09\]). None of these contrasts reached statistical significance.

These results indicate that there were no significant differences in the magnitude of indirect effects among PCI warmth, rejection, structure, and interactiveness as mediators in the associations between negative life experiences and adolescent psychopathology.

# Overall Model Comparison and Summary of Findings

This study examined the associations between negative life experiences (NLE) and adolescent psychopathology, specifically internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and tested whether parent–child interaction (PCI) dimensions (warmth, rejection, structure, and interactiveness) mediated these relationships. Two operationalizations of NLE were used as predictors: mean severity (Models 1 and 3) and total number of events (Models 2 and 4). Covariates in all models included child sex, child age, and income-to-needs ratio (ITN).

#### Model Comparisons

**Internalizing Psychopathology (Models 1 and 2):** Model 1 showed a significant positive association between mean severity of NLE and internalizing symptoms, even after accounting for PCI mediators. In contrast, Model 2 found no significant total effect of the number of NLEs on internalizing psychopathology. Across both models, PCI rejection was the only dimension significantly predicted by the number of NLE (Model 2), but PCI dimensions generally did not mediate the relationship between NLE and internalizing symptoms. Parental structure demonstrated a marginal (Model 1) to significant (Model 2) negative association with internalizing symptoms, suggesting a potential buffering effect.

**Externalizing Psychopathology (Models 3 and 4):** Both models showed significant positive effects of NLE severity (Model 3) and total number of events (Model 4) on externalizing psychopathology. Similar to internalizing models, parental rejection was positively associated with the number of NLE (Model 4). None of the PCI dimensions significantly mediated the effects of NLE on externalizing symptoms, and direct effects of NLE remained significant after accounting for PCI variables.

#### Mediation and Contrasts Across Models

Bootstrapped analyses indicated small and non-significant total indirect effects of PCI mediators in all models. Specific indirect effects for PCI warmth, rejection, structure, and interactiveness were also nonsignificant, with confidence intervals consistently including zero. Contrasts of the absolute indirect effects revealed no significant differences in mediation strength among PCI dimensions across all models.

#### Interpretation and Implications

Overall, the findings suggest that while negative life experiences (both in terms of severity and number) are significantly associated with adolescent psychopathology—particularly externalizing symptoms—parent–child interaction dimensions do not significantly mediate these relationships in this sample. Parental structure may play a modest protective role in reducing internalizing symptoms, but the evidence is tentative. Parental rejection appears to be influenced by the number of negative life events but does not mediate psychopathology outcomes.

These results highlight the direct impact of negative life experiences on adolescent mental health and suggest that PCI variables, as measured here, may not fully explain the pathways linking adversity to psychopathology. Future research should consider alternative mediators or moderators, as well as potential measurement and contextual factors influencing PCI effects.
